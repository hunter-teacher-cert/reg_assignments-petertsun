# Drone Delivery

[Source for this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/08/18/drone-delivery-is-live-today-and-its-90-cheaper-than-car-based-services/?sh=4c41a9cf4d02)  

There is a company in Ireland that is using autonomous drones
to make a lot of deliveries everyday. According to the article,
the company make at least 2000 deliveries with drones each day.
Even though the drones are autonomous, there is a person who
monitors three drones simultaneously. It is similar to self-checkout
machines where there is a person monitoring 10 checkout computers.  

The drones can carry light items like small packages and food orders.
Heavier items will still have to moved by cars or trucks. The nice
thing about drone delivery is that the product arrive within hours
of ordering. Also, the cost of delivery is a lot lower than a person
driving to an address to deliver an item.  

I am interested in this article because it invovles computer
science and new technology.  

I would send students to PBS nova website, popular mechanics, and wired websites
to find news on technology.
