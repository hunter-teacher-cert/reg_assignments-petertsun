Aim: How do we integrate physical electronics with programming?

Standards: 4-6.CT.1
Develop a computational model of a system that
shows changes in output when there are changes in inputs.

Materials: Tinkercad

Review:

Let us review how we build a simple electrical circuit.

Pre-lesson Q: What do you know about the word digital?
 Q: What is the difference between digital and analog?

Examples:

Use Blinking arduino example

 - Differentiation: use the basic sample as is.

Use Blinking example, but introduce the declaration of
global variable: use ledPin instead pin number 8

 - Differentiation: modify the example with global variable

Use Blinking example, but add the use of mini breadboard for laying foundation

 - Differentiation: add to the complexity with a mini breadboard

Additional Examples:

Introduce digital input arduino example: Input serial pullup

 - Differentiation: use the basic circuit as it is.

Use the digital input example with the introduction of global variable

 - Differentiation: modify the code to modify the physical behavior

Use LED and resistor to modify the physical interface.

 - Differentiation: bring in the use of physical components to interact with code

Post Q: What did you learn about digital?
Q: How is digital and analog different?

Lab:

Students try out the examples themselves to
check if they can use arduino to output digital information
and take a digital input.
