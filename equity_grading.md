# Grading to Support and Motivate students

I think it is a good idea to base grading on mastery
of content instead of behavior. For example, I like the idea
of not training students to think of learning as collecting
point but to think of learning as a way to do something useful
or to perform well on exams. I would try to not penalize students
for handing in work late. Instead, I will provide feedback and
develop a communication with students on when they cannot make it on time.
