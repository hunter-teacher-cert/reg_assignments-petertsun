# Good and the Bad

## Peter Tsun

In one lesson, I was doing live coding on creating a computer animation of a unit circle to show the connection between trigonometric functions and a revolving circle. The students' feedback to me on this lesson is that the lesson is too much or too hard. To make it better, I will break up the complex programs, and go through each component over two to three days.

In one lesson, I gave students code for recursion, and gave them opportunities to improvise the starter code to produce a variety of interesting geometirc figures with recursion. The students liked the lesson because they got to explore different possibilities and see the immediate results of their tweaking. During the process, they had a great time learning about recursion.
