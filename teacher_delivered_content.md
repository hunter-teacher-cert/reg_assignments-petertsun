objective: introduce students to digital processing in physical computing?

warm-up: what do you know about how to turn a light on?

intro:
review a basic construction of a light circuit

introduce the use of tinkercad to learn physical computing.
- build a light bulb circuit
- build a LED circuit

Q: How can we can a light to turn on and off periodically

- use an embedded microprocessor to control the light on and off

- explain that the digital aspect is similar to boolean data type.

- provide students with chance to build their circuit and to build
  a circuit controlled by arduino
